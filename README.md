The browser editor does have code completion, but it's behind a paywall. Good thing that someone made a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LeetCode.vscode-leetcode) that is able to use the LeetCode API. This allows me to:
- use a good IDE with code completion
- conveniently build a GitHub repository with my solutions
